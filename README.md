# FallDetection
A Fall Detection System built using OpenCV and MediaPipe in Python. The system monitors real-time video feeds, detects falls by analyzing human movements, and triggers an alert mechanism to notify caregivers or emergency responders.

🔧 Technologies Used
Python – Core programming language
OpenCV – Video processing & camera handling
MediaPipe – Human pose estimation
NumPy/Pandas – Data analysis (if needed)

📌 Features
✅ Real-Time Monitoring – Captures and processes video streams
✅ Pose Estimation – Tracks body landmarks (shoulders, elbows, hips, etc.)
✅ Fall Detection Algorithm – Detects falls based on body orientation & movement patterns
✅ Automated Alerts – Sends notifications via SMS, email, or sound alarms
✅ Healthcare Coordination – Can assist in dispatching medical personnel
